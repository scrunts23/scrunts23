### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Ryan 
I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple GitHub Readme files thatHi, Iâ€™m Ryan. Welcome to my tiny corner of Github! I am a Data Scientist with a particular interest in modeling based on sample datasets.

I am interested in combining those skills with data science to help build engaging and cutting-edge projects.

If you like to know me please feel free to contact me! I am always looking for collaboration on any project.you can copy/paste and use in your profile.
